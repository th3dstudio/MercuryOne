# Mercury 1.1 Motion System Files

This directory contains the base Mercury 1.1 files obtained from the ZeroG configurators on August 1, 2022. These files have been tested and verified by TH3D to be a complete and functional package. See the "Source Files and Attributions" section below for links to the Mercury One project.

Because the ZeroG Mercury One project is under active development, there may be newer versions of the files available from ZeroG directly. Files obtained directly from ZeroG may not be backwards-compatible with the files in this package. If you wish to use the latest version of the Mercury One motion system, we recommend following instructions provided by ZeroG and obtaining the latest version of the files from their configurators directly. Documentation in this guide will reflect the files TH3D is providing in this directory ONLY.

# Notes On Installation

The files in this directory are provided as they were downloaded from the configurators. At time of writing, we have not modified the files in any way.

**The Mercury One motion system requires additional printed carriage components in order complete a fully-functioning motion system. These files are included in the EVA Carriage Files directory.**

The files provided here include the stepper motor towers, belt-tensioning towers, and X-axis gantry (X-joint) components. These files do NOT contain any carriage components or belt clamps.

In this CoreXY design, the belt paths terminate on the hot-end carriage. In addition to the files in this directory, you will be required to print a minimum of two (2) EVA carriage components for the motion system to be complete.

Alternatively, you may choose to use the Afterburner or Stealthburner carriages provided by ZeroG. Please see their site and instructions if you choose to use these carriages, rather than the EVA carriage from this repo.
