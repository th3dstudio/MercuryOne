# Notes On Installation

The files in this directory are provided as they were downloaded from the configurators. At time of writing, we have not modified the files in any way.

**The Mercury One motion system requires additional printed carriage components in order complete a fully-functioning motion system. These files are included in the EVA Carriage Files directory.**

The files provided here include the stepper motor towers, belt-tensioning towers, and X-axis gantry (X-joint) components. These files do NOT contain any carriage components or belt clamps.

In this CoreXY design, the belt paths terminate on the hot-end carriage. In addition to the files in this directory, you will be required to print a minimum of two (2) EVA carriage components for the motion system to be complete.

Alternatively, you may choose to use the Afterburner or Stealthburner carriages provided by ZeroG. Please see their site and instructions if you choose to use these carriages, rather than the EVA carriage from this repo.

# Versioning

This directory contains several versions of the Mercury One.1 motion system. We recommend using the latest version available in this directory, however the files provided for each version should be complete and usable if desired.
