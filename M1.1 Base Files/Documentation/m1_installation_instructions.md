# Mercury One Installation Instructions

## 1. What to Print/Glossary of Terms

Print one of every file in the "M1.1 Base Files" directory, see [the Bill of Materials and Component list](m1_BOM-and-parts-list.md) for details. Before beginning project assembly, you should have the following:

1. Stepper mounts (total 4 pieces): Each stepper mount consists of a "top" and "bottom" portion. Two complete stepper mount assemblies are required, one each for the left and right sides of the printer.

2. X Joints (total 4 pieces, heat-sets required): Each X Joint consists of a "top" and "bottom" portion. Two complete X joint assemblies are required, one each for the left and right sides of the printer. The "bottom" half of each assembly requires 3x heat-set inserts to be prepared ahead of time.

3. Front Towers (total 2 pieces, heat-sets required): Tensioning towers for the belt system, installed on the front side of the printer. One of each tower (left and right) is required. Each tower requires 1x heat-set insert (see Documentation folder for pictures) to be prepared ahead of time.

4. Front Tension Plates (total 2 pieces): Used with the Front Towers for tensioning the belts. Files are marked "1" and "2" for clarity/tracking, simply print one of each file as listed in the directory.

5. Spacers (total 8 pieces): There are two types of spacer needed to complete the X Joint assemblies, and each type of spacer includes a "short" and a "tall" file. "FlangeSpacer" components are used with flanged-bearing stacks and are flat on both sides. "tIdlerSpacers" are used with toothed idler pulley assemblies and have a small lip on one side for the pulley to rest on. Files are marked "1" and "2" for clarity/tracking, simply print one of each file as listed in the directory.

6. Z-Drop Brackets (total 2 pieces): These replace the aluminum smooth-rod brackets for the Z axis and provide additional clearance for the hot-end. These replace ONLY the top aluminum T-brackets, the bottom aluminum brackets are retained. Files are marked "1" and "2" for clarity/tracking, simply print one of each file as listed in the directory.

## 2. Prepare Kit Components and Printed Parts

### Printed Parts

Print and prepare the Printed Parts according to the [Bill Of Materials](m1_BOM-and-parts-list.md#printed-components). Use [these recommended print settings](m1_print_settings.md) for best results.

### Heat-set Inserts

Printed parts requiring heat-set inserts must be prepared in advance. Please see [the recommended print settings page](m1_print_settings.md) for more information.

### Motor Pulleys

You will be required to install GT2 toothed pulleys onto the X and Y motors. One pulley is installed in the opposite orientation from the other. Ensure that the pulley's grub screw aligns with the flat face of the motor shaft to prevent loosening/wear over time. These can be installed later during installation, however it is recommended to prepare them ahead of time to prevent removing the motor from the bracket repeatedly. We will adjust the height of the pulleys on the shafts later during belt installation, this preparation simply prevents extra work during that process.

### Linear Rails

Clean rails if needed. Ensure smooth motion and proper lubrication.

## 3. Prepare Ender 5 Chassis

### Remove original X and Y components

### Install Z-Drop Brackets
