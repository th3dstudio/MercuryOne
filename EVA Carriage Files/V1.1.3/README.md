# Version 1.1.3

This folder contains a previous version of the EVA carriage and hot-end mounting system. **These files use a combination of heat-set inserts and hex nuts** to attach components together. If you wish to avoid using hex nuts, refer to version 1.1.4 or later of these files.

# Additional Notes:

This directory contains files for ZeroG's modified EVA 2.4 carriage for the Mercury One open-source project. We used their configurator to grab files designed for **BMG-style extruders** and **E3D V6-compatible hot-ends** with **inductive sensor mounts** and uploaded them here with no modifications.

The Mercury One system cannot operate without a minimum of carriage components, as these are the terminal points for the belts. **At a minimum, to complete the Mercury One motion system you will require the top carriage component to attach to the MGN rail, the front universal faceplate, and two printed belt clamps:**

- Extruder_X_Limit_Top_BMG_MGN12.stl
- EVA_FrontPlate_HD_V1-1-1.stl
- Belt_Clamp_1.stl (print either two of these, or one Belt_Clamp_1 and one Belt_Clamp_2)

**For best stability, you should print all four "base components" of the EVA carriage, including the files listed above plus the following:**

- EVA2-4_Bottom_V1-1.stl
- EVA_Backplate_Merc_Support_V1-1.stl
