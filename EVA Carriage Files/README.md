# EVA 2.4 Carriage and Hot-end System

These files are ZeroG's modified EVA 2.4 carriage for the Mercury One open-source project. We used their configurator to grab files designed for **BMG-style extruders** and **E3D V6-compatible hot-ends** with **inductive sensor mounts**.

The Mercury One system cannot operate without a minimum of carriage components, as these are the terminal points for the belts. **At a minimum, to complete the Mercury One motion system you will require the top carriage component to attach to the MGN rail, the front universal faceplate, and two printed belt clamps:**

- `BMG_TOP.stl`
- `a_EVA_FrontPlate_HD_V1-1-1.stl`
- `Belt_Clamp_1.stl` (print either two of these, or one `Belt_Clamp_1.stl` and one `Belt_Clamp_2.stl`)

**For best stability, you should print all four "base components" of the EVA carriage, including the files listed above plus the following:**

- `EVA2-4_Bottom_V1-1.stl`
- `a_EVA_Backplate_Merc_Support_V1-1.stl`

# Versioning

This directory contains several versions of the EVA Carriage system for the Mercury One project. We recommend using the latest version available in this directory, however the files provided for each version should be complete and usable if desired.
